idedosfs: FUSE filesystem module for IDEDOS hard disk images
plus3dosfs: FUSE filesystem module for +3DOS partitions within an idedosfs

To start idedosfs just run "./start <hdf-file>"; this will start idedosfs on <hdf-file> (mounting on mnt/) and then, for each partition in the image, if the type is supported, start its fs (mounting on sub/<partition-index>).  For now the only supported type is 0x03 "+3DOS", which is handled by plus3dosfs.

To stop idedosfs just run "./stop"; this will unmount the sub/ mounts and then unmount mnt/.

Extended File Attributes:
All the FSes use xattrs to communicate out-of-band data like file/partition types.
To read these you will need getfattr(2) or the <attr/xattr.h> functions.  On Debian these are packaged in 'attr' and 'libattr1-dev'.
The xattrs are listed for each FS, below.
=idedosfs=
	user.idedos.pt	On partitions, gives the IDEDOS partition type (eg. "1" = IDEDOS System Partition, "3" = +3DOS)
	user.plus3dos.xdpb.ndirent	On +3DOS partitions, gives the number of directory entries, from the eXDPB
	user.plus3dos.xdpb.nblocks	On +3DOS partitions, gives the number of blocks, from the eXDPB
	user.plus3dos.xdpb.bsh	On +3DOS partitions, gives the Block SHift, from the eXDPB
=plus3dosfs=
	user.plus3dos.plus3basic.filetype	Gives the file type (0 = BASIC program, 1 = Number array, 2 = Character array, 3 = Code file or SCREEN$)
	user.plus3dos.plus3basic.line	On BASIC program files, gives the LINE value or 0x8000
	user.plus3dos.plus3basic.prog	On BASIC program files, gives the start of the variable area (which is the second tape parameter)
	user.plus3dos.plus3basic.name	On array files, gives the array's name
	user.plus3dos.plus3basic.addr	On code files, gives the code address

Known Bugs:
=idedosfs=
*	Writing isn't supported yet.
=plus3dosfs=
*	Files which span more than one extent aren't handled currently; only data in the first extent can be read.
*	The offset for the start of the data isn't being calculated (because I don't know how); it's just grovelling the partition until it finds some data.
*	Writing isn't supported yet, nor file-creation, or indeed anything but readdir/getattr/open/read.
